        <p>transmission range:<br>the range in which a transmitter can pass its information for its best</p>
<p>three kinds of networks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Almost connected networks:<br>— Relatively dense, exhibits partitions. Good percentage of pairs are connected end-to-end at any time. Traditional protocols could still diliver a part of the traffic, but unable to deliver any traffic between nodes that lie in different partitions. Opportunistic forwarding complementing path-based protocols.</li>
<li>Sparse networks<br>— No large clusters exist. Nodes are isolated most of the time. Two nodes come into contact for a limited contact duration. A message must be routed predominantly by opportunistic forwarding. When a new candidate is encountered, the forwarding scheme must decide whether it should handover the message, forward a copy or do nothing. Available bandwidth per contact and/or node buffer space are the limiting factors as far as performance is concerned. Forwarding or scheduling techniques that aim to choose the right neighbor or combine packets for different neighbors will not offer much here.</li>
<li>Clusters or Connectivity Islands<br>— Exhibits significant clustering and community structure, with well defined islands of (good) connectivity, and few or no contemporary oaths between clusters.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mobility:<br>It defines how a sequence of connectivity graph snapshots may look like, how the properties of subsequent snapshots depend on the current one.<br>Responsible for the amount of variability between different realizations of the network over time, but also for the ability to predict how the experienced realization will evolve and result in future contacts.</p>
<p>Mobility Intensity:<br>The magnitude of the surface area it traverses in a given amount of time. The larger this area, the more the contact( and thus forwarding opportunities this node will have), and, the shorter duration of these occuring contacts as well.<br>Related to the absolute speed of the node and the frequency and duration of pauses.</p>
<p>Mobility Locality:<br>Relates the mobility of a node to the total network area. A given node may move within only a small subset of locations and never or infrequently visit the rest of the network.<br>Recent models attempt to reproduce this behavior by assigning “home locations” to each node.<br>Mark: Markov chain</p>
<p>Mobility Regularity:<br>The expectation of periodicity and pattern.</p>
<p>Mobility Heterogeneity:<br>Nodes may exhibit significant diferences with other nodes’ patterns.</p>
<p>Mobility Correlations:<br>While not all nodes in a given mobility scenario are expected to exhibit uniform mobility characteristics, subsets of nodes will be subject to higher correlations in their preferred locations and visiting patterns.</p>
<p>Node Resources:<br>Bandwidth<br>Storage<br>Battery Lifetime<br>Heterogeneous Node Capabilities(*)</p>
<h3 id="11-3-Dealing-with-uncertainty"><a href="#11-3-Dealing-with-uncertainty" class="headerlink" title="11.3 Dealing with uncertainty"></a><a href="#11-3_Dealing_with_uncertainty" title="11.3 Dealing with uncertainty"></a>11.3 Dealing with uncertainty</h3><p><strong>Model 1: Epidemic Routing</strong><br>Each node maintains a message vector indicating which messages the current node is storing in its buffer. When two nodes encounter, they first exchange and compare their message vectors. Then they exchange all messages not in common, so that, at the end of the contact, both nodes are storing exactly the same messages.<br>Positive: guaranteed to find the shortest space-time path<br>Negative: </p>
<ol>
<li>immense overhead per message. In a network of N nodes, the overhead of epidemic routing grows to infinity as $\frac{N}{\log N}$ unless some special measures are taken.</li>
<li>If node buffer space and contact bandwidth are limited, epidemic routing is no longer optimal. Depending on the buffer management and scheduling policies, new messages may kick out old messages before the latter are delivered, leading to congestion collapse phenomena.</li>
</ol>
<p>Revision 1: IMMUNE_TX and VACCINE recovery schemes:<br>After a destination receives a message, it propagates “anti-messages” to infected nodes and, respectively to all nodes. Since anti-messages have much smaller sizes(only message ID), the overhead is effectively reduced.</p>
<p>Revision 2: Gossiping or Randomized Flooding:<br>Copy a message during a contact with a probability $p$ less than 1.<br>OR<br>ASllow each relay to copy the message to at most $k$ other nodes.<br>Requires a priori knowledge of global network parameters. In practice, all these schemes result in almost every node receiving a copy of each message.</p>
<p>Revision 3: Limited-time Flooding:<br>Set a threshold on the epidemic routing time. Before the threshold timer expires, messages are spread using epidemic routing. When the timer expires, any node with the message may only transmit it directly to the destination.<br>Carefully selection of the timer is needed.<br>Very useful for analytical purposes.</p>
<p>Revision 4: 2-hop scheme:<br>Allow only the source of a message to create and forward replicas.<br>In an uniform mobility environment, this scheme results in an average number of $\frac{N-1}{2}$ transmission per message. Yet only paths of at most 2 hops can be used, only for very local mobility scenarios.</p>
<p>SLEF(Self-Limiting Epidemic Forwarding):<br>Reduce the number of hops each message is allowed to traverse, as a function of the perceived congestion.<br>An online mechanism to infer local congestion is necessary for SLEF to operate.<br>A sensible solution for applications like the broadcasting of location-related content, not suitable for generic, end-to-end unicast or multicast.</p>
<p><strong>Model 2: Controlled Replication Schemes</strong><br>Often referred to as <em>Spray and Wait</em><br>Ensure that each message is delivered with at most L transmissions, where $L\ll N$. Different flavors of spraying achieve this goal with different policies during the first “spraying” phase:</p>
<ol>
<li>Source Spraying: The source os a message alone may create additional copies and forward them to encountered relays.<br>Difference to 2-hop scheme: the source stops after having distributed $L-1$ copies or sooner, if the destination was among the first L-1 nodes encountered. Then, the source and the relays may only forward the message to the destination, which is the “wait” phase.</li>
<li>Binary Spraying: To speed up the spraying phase, relays can be also allowed to spread copies further. To ensure that the total number of copies remains $\leq$ L, a quota system is implemented.<blockquote>
<p>(i)the source starts with one message copy and a quota of L allowed replications<br>(ii)when a node with a message copy and a quota $i&gt;1$ encounters a relay without a copy, it forwards a message copy and half of the quota. Then they both have quota of $[i/2]$<br>(iii)a node with a copy and a quota of 1 may only forward the message to the destination</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Under IID(independent and identically distributed) mobility, binary spraying has the shortest delay among all quota0based spraying methods.</li>
<li>Source spraying may be preferred in some scenarios where only the source can be <em>relied on</em> to spread copies.</li>
<li>If the mobility model is characterized by high mobility intensity and low locality, Spray and Wait can achieve similar delays to epidemic routing with almost an order of magnitude fewer transmissions.</li>
<li>The performance increase, when using more and more replicas, obeys a <em>law of diminishing returns</em></li>
<li>One can analytically solve for the number of copies to achieve a desired performance compared to the optimal (epidemic under no resource constraints) — independent of the actual mobility model and independent of the size of the geographic area in which network nodes are moving.</li>
<li>Performance of controlled replication algorithms can drop rapidly when nodes show strong location preference, correlated mobility, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="11-4-Capitalizing-on-structure-Utility-based-forwarding"><a href="#11-4-Capitalizing-on-structure-Utility-based-forwarding" class="headerlink" title="11.4 Capitalizing on structure: Utility-based forwarding"></a><a href="#11-4_Capitalizing_on_structure_3A_Utility-based_forwarding" title="11.4 Capitalizing on structure: Utility-based forwarding"></a>11.4 Capitalizing on structure: Utility-based forwarding</h3><p> A number of sophisticated opportunistic forwarding schemes are based on the following basic functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collect and analyze some statistics about past contacts among (all or a subset of) nodes;</li>
<li>Assign a utility for each node based on these statistics; this utility may be <em>destination-dependent</em> or <em>destination-independent</em> and aims at quantifying the ability of a candidate next hop to deliver the message probablistically closer to a destination.</li>
<li>Perform a deterministic or probabilistic decision as a function of the current relay’s and the candidate relay’s utilities (and perhaps additional parameters).</li>
</ol>
<p>Utility-based single-copy algorithms<br>When the node currently holding the message encounters another node with a higher utility than the current one, the message is handed over and no local copy is retained. (Exception: the source node)</p>
<p>Contact-based Utility:<br>Mobility: key role as both an enabler and differentiator between nodes’ future contact probabilities. </p>
<p><strong>Model 1: Pair-based Contact Utilities</strong><br>individual node pair: an intended destination and a node being evaluated as candidate relay for that destination.<br>Properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Age of Last Encounter: the time elapsed since two nodes last encountered each other.<br>In DTNs, when nodes are heterogeneous in terms of their characteristics and capabilities, additional parameters should be used in combination with the age of last encounter.<br>If node mobility is relatively uniform, the age of last encounter only offers benefits in denser connectivity environments</li>
<li>History of Past Encounters: keep track of a longer history of past contact and their statistics.<br>Derive different utilities: frequency &amp; contact duration</li>
<li>More Complex Pair Contact Predictors</li>
<li>Pattern of Visited Location: People tend to follow a <em>movement pattern</em> in their daily activities. <em>Location preference</em> as well as the periodic nature of human mobility have been consistently demonstrated in a variety of real mobility traces.<br>Mobility patterns could help identify a <em>profile</em> for a given node; nodes with a mobility profile matching or similar to the destination can be considered good candidate relays for messages to that destination.</li>
</ol>
<p>Maintenance and Overhead of Contact Statistics: Exponentially Weighted time Averages(EWMA) are more often used.</p>
<p><strong>Model 2: Contact Graph Utilities</strong><br>pairwise contact metrics might fail in cases, for example, when X rarely meets D, but X meets Y often and Y meets D often. Or, X meets many nodes in general and thus increasing the chances to meet D.</p>
<p>Complex networks and social networks<br>Key steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the contact graph out of a sequence of past (instantaneous) connectivity graphs</li>
<li>Use contact graph properties to compose a utility function that efficiently identifies “good” next hops.</li>
</ol>
<p>A sequence of binary matrices <strong>A(t)</strong> corresponds to the connectivity as each time instant t.</p>
<ol>
<li>Weighted graph: A scalar weight $w<em>{ij}$ is derived as a function of the **$A(t)</em>{ij}$** for some past time window(eg, $[t_1, t<em>2]$).$w</em>{ij} = f(A(t<em>{1})</em>{ij}, A(t<em>{1}+1)</em>{ij}, …, A(t<em>{2})</em>{ij})$</li>
<li>Unweighted graph: if the contact graph is unweighted, then a link may either exist or not exist. This could be achieved for example by introducing a cutoff threshold for weights: if the link weight $w_{ij}$ is below this value, then it is removed from the contact graph.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some key properties that seem to underlie many mobility scenarios for contact graphs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Community structure: Contact graphs seem to exhibit considerable community structure with subsets of nodes well-connected to each other, with fewer or weaker links between subsets.</li>
<li>Small world: Contact graphs exhibit small world properties, namely very short paths between any two nodes usually exist. However, it does not imply that these paths can be easily found.</li>
<li>Skewed degree distribution: Contact graph weight distributions and node degree distributions exhibit considerable heterogeneity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Centrality-based Utility:<br>The <em>betweeness centrality</em> of a node $i$ is defined as the number of shortest paths between any network nodes going through node $i$.  Nodes with high betweeness centrality can serve as “bridges” between communities relaying the message from the community the source lies in to the community the destination lies in.<br>Cannot be easily calculated since it requires global network information</p>
<p>The <em>degree centrality</em> is the degree of the node in the contact graph (or the sum of link weights, in the weighted case).<br>Essentially related to the amount of mobility of a given node and the total rate of meetings of that node with all other network nodes.</p>
<p>The <em>Similarity-based Utility</em> is the similarity between two nodes. Two nodes are <em>similar</em> if they have a lot of common neighbors in the contact graph. </p>
<p><em>Complete Social Network Analysis-based Schemes</em><br>SimBet uses a per node utility that takes into account both the similarity of a given relay $i$ with the intended destination $d$ (denoted as $Sim_i(d)$ here), as well as the ego-centrality of the same relay, $Bet_i$<br>$U_i(d) = \alpha Sim_i(d) + \beta Bet_i$</p>
<p><em>Probabilistic Path-based Utilities</em><br>node $i$ may be a good next hop because it is in the beginning of a space-time path that has a high chance of realization.</p>
<p><strong>Non-contact-based Utility</strong><br>Forward or replicate a message to a relay based upon the available resources in order to maximize the likelihood of message delivery, when two nodes meet. In some examples, utilities are defined based on the total buffer occupancy permessage. Messages then are ordered with respect to their utilities, keeping in view the goal of optimizing specific quantities, which allows computation of desired performance metrics such as worst-case delivery delay and packet delivery ratio. </p>
<p><em>Social Relations</em><br>People who are socially-related to each other are expected to interact more often with each other.</p>
<h3 id="11-5-Hybrid-solutions-Combining-Redundancy-and-Utility"><a href="#11-5-Hybrid-solutions-Combining-Redundancy-and-Utility" class="headerlink" title="11.5 Hybrid solutions: Combining Redundancy and Utility"></a><a href="#11-5_Hybrid_solutions_3A_Combining_Redundancy_and_Utility" title="11.5 Hybrid solutions: Combining Redundancy and Utility"></a>11.5 Hybrid solutions: Combining Redundancy and Utility</h3><p><strong>Utility-based Flooding</strong><br>Pass the value to another node if it satisfies the utility criterion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Absolute utility criterion: $U<em>j(d) &gt; U</em>{thresh}$</li>
<li>Relative utility criterion: $U_j(d) &gt; U<em>i(d) + U</em>{thresh}$</li>
</ol>
<p>Eg. PRoPHET is a utility-based flooding scheme, and it has the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>it increases when i meets d</li>
<li>it decreases with time, when i is not in contact with d</li>
<li>it increases when i meets another node j, with a non-zero utility for d</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Spray and Utility-based Spraying</strong><br>A source could spray the limited budget of copies quickly after message creation, and then allow each copy to be further forwarded(hand over, not copied) using an appropriate utility-based scheme.<br><em>Spray and Focus</em> performs binary spraying of L copies, as in the <em>Spray and Wait</em> case. However, after the replication quota for a relay node reaches 1, it can still hand over its copy to another, better relay, if it encounters one. The utility is a simple pairwise contact utility, similar to the one in PRoPHET.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Replication</strong><br>Use explicit “labels” or a degree centrality estimate as the utility. Then, binary or source spraying is employed, with copies forwarded only to relays that either have a higher utility or have a high enough utility.</p>
